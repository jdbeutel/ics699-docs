ICS MS project proposal: contact info sharing web app
=====================================================

For my ICS 699 project, I would like to implement a contact info sharing web app.  It will enable friends and family to collaborate in maintaining their address books.  I normally don't use addresses until I send out holiday cards, at which point the Post Office returns a few because the addressee has moved.  Then I need to contact friends or relatives to get the updated address.  With this app, only one person would need to update the address, benefitting everyone else who is sharing it.


Background
----------

I have done several class projects in this direction:

* Spring 2009 ICS 667:  Agile Usage-Centered Design of a Social Networking Contact Book
* Fall 2009 ICS 668:  Managing Privacy for Transitive Sharing on a Social networking Site (literature review)
* Spring 2010 ICS 664:  We'll Call You (partial UI prototype)


Issues
------

* privacy
* identity
* unification


Tentative Schedule
------------------

* look for relevant publications since 2009
* update prototype to current Grails
* authentication via Facebook, Google, etc
* email
* history
* permissions


Scope
-----

* no mobile
